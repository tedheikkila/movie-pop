    1. CSS framework = bootstrap
    2. interactive:
        -homepage:
            -user clicks on 3 different API buttons on homepage
            -user types in movie title
        -in each API 
            -user can see previous previously search movies as buttons
            -user can search for new movies
            -go back button to get to the main screen/home page

    3. checked off at least 2 server side APIs (these are public API free):
        -realgood, NYT movies reviews
        -NYT reviews left hand side (free)
        -realgood: middle section shows where you can watch the movie (might $)
        -trailer: traileraddict (free)

    4. no alerts (done)
    5. local storage 
        
        -NYT review, realgood, traileraddict: previously movie search 
        -store it, bring it back as a button to be clicked on
    6. polished UI (homepage and 3 API separate windows)
    7. clean repo 
        -comments; 
        -please indent
        -naming conventions: varName (Js)
            -HTML: var-name; try to do classes for most things; style id second
        -use jQuery as much as possible
        -file name: hw1-project-something
        -project title: movie pops; popping reviews 
    8. quality readme (Lillian); screenshots

    presentation:
        -do later

    
    UI homepage:

    search bar on each; drop-down menu, button click event
        


Group Project notes:
1. Before starting on a subject, check and see if the 2 APIs are workable (free)
2. Readme is an encapsulation of the project presentation; this one will be more extensive
3. New technology requirement: use a third API; jQuery UI; be ambitious w/in reason
4. Have a header w/title and navigation links to the 3 sections of API
5. API’s are laid out horizontally in desktop view, then shrink and stack vertically at phone level
6. 3 API are/could be where the user rates something out of 5 stars; once the star is checked for that section, the star persists; it could load a second item after user clicks
7. Need good APIs that users would be interested in
8. Homescreen has 3 buttons w/3 background images; once user selects one button it directs user into that particular API; API has a search bar to search for a movie; user can then click the movie and it brings you to say rotten tomatoes 
9. Need to find a list of public APIs
